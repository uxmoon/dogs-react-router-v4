# React dog app

Based on **Router exercises** from "The Modern React Bootcamp" by _Colt Steele_.

## Notes

A small and simple to learn how to work with Routing in React using React Router.

The course is a little outdated and I'm using React Router v4 for this exercise.

**Explorations:**

- Use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for Tooling instead of Create React App
- Integrate [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- Added custom CSS to styles list and details page
- Added [React Helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-helmet) to change page titles
